Welcome! I'm Riccardo Pinosio. I'm director of R&D at [Knights Analytics](https://www.knightsanalytics.com). Before that I was a technologist at [Avanade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avanade) and data scientist at [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/). I'm also on the scientific advisory board of [digi.bio](https://digi.bio).

I hold a PhD in logic from the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl) and lecture in machine learning at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/) and [CMI](https://www.cmihva.nl/en/).

I prefer to work at the intersection of R&D, business, and engineering because that's where product innovation happens. My current focus is on NLP (information extraction, entity resolution), large-scale knowledge graphs & representation learning, and (neuro)-symbolic AI, with applications primarily to AI assisted data engineering and AI analytics automation in banking, finance, healthcare, and life sciences.

Other than that I love open source, [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and weird programming languages that provide new perspectives on computation.

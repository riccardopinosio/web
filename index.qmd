Welcome to my website! I'm Riccardo Pinosio, AI/ML scientist/engineer hybrid *extraordinaire* (or so I like to think).

I am director of R&D at [Knights Analytics](https://www.knightsanalytics.com). Before that I was a technologist at [avanade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avanade) and data scientist at [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/). I am also a scientific advisor for [digi.bio](https://digi.bio) on the application of ML to biological imaging experiments.

I hold a PhD in logic from the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl) and lecture in machine learning at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/) and [CMI](https://www.cmihva.nl/en/).

I prefer to work at the intersection of research and engineering because that's where product innovation that really breaks stuff happens. I'm currently focusing on NLP (information extraction, entity resolution), large-scale knowledge graphs & representation learning, and (neuro)-symbolic AI.

Other than that I love open source, [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), weird programming languages, and literature (avid Proust fan).

## Contacts

The best way to get in contact with me is to email me at riccardo@knightsanalytics.com, or to shoot me a DM on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardopinosio).

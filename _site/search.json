    "text": "Welcome to my website! I’m Riccardo Pinosio, AI/ML scientist/engineer hybrid extraordinaire (or so I like to think).\nI am director of R&D at Knights Analytics. Before that I was a technologist at avanade and data scientist at Funda. I am also a scientific advisor for digi.bio on the application of ML to biological imaging experiments.\nI hold a PhD in logic from the ILLC and lecture in machine learning at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and CMI.\nI prefer to work at the intersection of research and engineering because that’s where product innovation that really breaks stuff happens. I’m currently focusing on NLP (information extraction, entity resolution), large-scale knowledge graphs & representation learning, and (neuro)-symbolic AI.\nOther than that I love open source, emacs, weird programming languages, and literature (avid Proust fan)."
